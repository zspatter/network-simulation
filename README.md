# Network-Simulation

This project is designed to simulate an organ transplant system. Its aim is to simulate potential problems that may occur while transporting organs from facility to facility. Factors that could affect the system include: the number of vehicles available in circulation, construction (closed roads), the amount of time an organ remains viable out of the human body, traffic, and natural disasters. For the purposes of this simulated model, problems during transport will be represented by removing paths between two given nodes. The system will handle these problems by finding alternative routes between two destinations.
